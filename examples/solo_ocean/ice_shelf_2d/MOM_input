/* This input file provides the adjustable run-time parameters for version 6 of
   the Modular Ocean Model (MOM6), a numerical ocean model developed at NOAA-GFDL.
   Where appropriate, parameters use usually given in MKS units.

   This particular file is for the example in solo_ocean/mixed_layer_restrat_2d.

   This MOM_input file typically contains only the non-default values that are
   needed to reproduce this example.  A full list of parameters for this example
   can be found in the corresponding MOM_parameter_doc.all file which is
   generated by the model at run-time. */
